# FAQ

## What is a namespace?

A **namespace** in PIPEFORCE is the unqiue name of your instance and is similar to a tenant id. So whenever you want to refer / link to your own instance you need the namespace to do so.

## Where can I find my namespace?

Whenever you need to define the namespace of your instance, this is referred to the subdomain part of your [pipeforce.net](http://pipeforce.net) instance url.
