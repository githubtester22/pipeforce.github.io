# Events

This is the reference documentation of the built-in events which come out-of-the-box with PIPEFORCE. 

Here is an example how to listen for such events in a **persisted** pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
 - event.listen:
     key: "iam.login.error"
 - log:
     message: "A login has been failed!"
```

Also see the **[Event Guide](../guides/event)** for details about the structure and usage of events.
