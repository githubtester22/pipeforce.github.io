# Email Pipeline

We can create templates (in html) for emails, and use them in our pipelines.

## 1 - Create an email template

1.  Login to the portal https://**NAMESPACE**.pipeforce.net
    
2.  Navigate to LOW CODE â†’ Workbench
    
3.  Select the node of your app or [create a new one](create-app).
    
4.  Click the plus icon at the top of the tree.
    
5.  The new property view opens:
    
    1.  As property key, use: `global/app/YOUR_APP/template/email`, where you can replace YOUR_APP with your own app name
        
    2.  As mime type, use: `text/plain; type=template; format=freemarker`
        
6.  Click `SAVE`
    
7.  The new property has been created, and the content editor was opened for you.
    
8.  Now copy and paste this content into the editor, and overwrite any existing data there by this:

```html
<div>
  <p>
    <b>Hallo Controlling Team,</b>
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p>
    <b>A request was made. What would you like to do next?</b>
  </p>
</div>
```

9.  Click `SAVE`


## 2 - Create an email pipeline
    
Now, we must create a pipeline where the emails' messages contain the content of this template.

1.  Click the plus icon at the top of the tree.
    
2.  The new property view opens:
    
    1.  As property key, use: `global/app/YOUR_APP/pipeline/myPipeline`, where you can replace YOUR_APP with your own app name
        
    2.  As mime type, use: `application/yaml; type=pipeline`
        
3.  Click `SAVE`
    
4.  The new property has been created, and the content editor was opened for you.
    
5.  Now copy and paste this content into the editor, and overwrite any existing data there by this:

```json
  pipeline:
  - mail.send:
      to: "your@domain.tld"
      subject: "Test email"
      message: "uri:property:global/app/YOUR-APP/template/send-email"
```

6.  Replace `your@domain.tld` by your real email address.
    
7.  Click `SAVE` and then `RUN` to execute the pipeline.

8.  After a while, you should have received an email like this:

    ![](../img/email-template.PNG)

Here, we created a simple pipeline where we send email where the message points to the template we created in the same app i.e. `uri:property:global/app/YOUR-APP/template/send-email`. Note that we must put `uri:property:` in the suffix of the template path here.
