# Pipeline Headers Reference

Each pipeline can have **optional** headers defined. A pipeline header is similar to a HTTP header and defines a global “configuration item” for the overall execution of the pipeline. In the example below you can see a pipeline with a header defined in the `headers` section:

```yaml
headers:
  description: "This is the hello world pipeline"
  
pipeline:
  - log:
      message: "Hello World!"
```

# Reference

It is possible to create custom headers and there are some pre-defined headers. Below you can find a reference of the pre-defined headers and their meanings.

| `apiVersion` | Defines the version of the pipeline API to be used (for example: `v2`, `v3`). If not set, the latest version is used automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `authorization` | Defines the authorization to be used for this pipeline. Has similar meaning as the HTTP `Authorization` header. Possible values are:<br/><br/>*   `RunAs USERNAME` \= Executes the given pipeline as the user with given username. This requires a valid seed authentication or a call from a trusted service.<br/>    <br/>*   `Bearer TOKEN` \= Uses the given (JWT) token for authentication.<br/>    <br/>*   `Basic CREDENTIALS` = Uses the given credentials for authentication.<br/>    <br/><br/>In case no authentication header is set in current pipeline, the existing authentication from the HTTP header or from the backend will be used instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `description` | An optional description of this pipeline. The text may contain at max. 250 characters.

| `exprPrefix` | Sometimes it is necessary to change the default prefix `#{` of an expression to a different value. For example if this clashes with some other expression engines. Example:<br/><br/>`expPrefix: "$"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `onCommandError` | Optional value to define what should happen if a single command in this pipeline has an error / exception. Possible values are:<br/><br/>*   `IGNORE` = Only the exception message (not the full stacktrace) is logged as warn, but no exception is thrown, so next command in pipeline will be executed.<br/>    <br/>*   `LOG` = The full stacktrace of the exception is logged as error, but no exception is thrown, so next command in pipeline will be executed.<br/>    <br/>*   `THROW` = The exception is thrown and the pipeline execution is stopped at this command. This is the default behavior in case this header doesnt exist or is empty.<br/>    <br/>*   `RETRY; times=3; wait=2; then=THROW;` If command caused an error, the command is again executed whereas all parameters are optional:<br/>    <br/>    *   `wait` = the time to wait in seconds before the next retry starts (default = 3).<br/>        <br/>    *   `times` = The number of retries before giving up (default = 1).<br/>        <br/>    *   `then =` The action to do after the retry was not successfull (one of `IGNORE`, `LOG` or `THROW`)(default = `THROW`).<br/>        <br/>*   `ROLLBACK[uri]` = Calls the given uri in order to execute a script to rollback. EXPERIMENTAL (ask our support team, if you want use this) |
| `runAs` | DEPRECATED Since version 7.0.

| `runWhen` | This header is primarily to configure a pipeline which is auto-executed on import or install but can be useful also in other cases. It defines a PE which evaluated on execution of the pipeline. If this expression returns `true`, the pipeline is executed, otherwise it is skipped and a info message is logged. Furthermore a warning is returned to the caller that this pipeline was skipped. If the header is not set, the pipeline is always executed.<br/><br/>Here is an example to run the pipeline only when in test mode:  <br/>`runWhen: "#{@instance.profiles().contains('test')}"`<br/><br/>Or when a certain namespace is set:  <br/>`runWhen: "#{@instance.namespace() == 'enterprise'}"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `tracing` | Since 7.5.<br/><br/>If this header is set to `false`, the pipeline and its commands are not trace logged on execution.
