# Event

An event can be used to listen inside a pipeline to certain things happened in PIPEFORCE or in other systems. Itâ€™s also possible to trigger such events from inside a pipeline.

## The Event JSON object

In PIPEFORCE an event is represented by a JSON object with a certain structure like this:

```json
{
  "eventKey": "string",
  "namespace": "string",
  "payload": {JSON},
  "async": true|false,
  "headers": {
    "key": "value",
    ...
  }
}
```

This event JSON object is automatically provided to you in the `body` of the pipeline and can be accessed from there by a [Pipeline Expression (PE)](../guides/pel.md).

### eventKey

Contains a unique key for this event type. The event keys are typically written lower case and in a dot notation where each part is separated by a dot.

Here are some examples of built-in event keys:

*   `property.created`
    
*   `property.deleted`
    
*   `setup.finished`
    

Events coming from external systems via webhooks must be prefixed with `webhook.systemname.` for example:

```
webhook.weclapp.order.created
```

Custom events (not part of the built-in events) must be prefixed with the reversed internet domain name of the creator. For example:

```
com.company.eventname
```

### namespace

The namespace (= tenant) where this event happened. If null or empty, the event was fired by a global instance.

### payload

The optional payload of the event as JSON object. The structure of this payload depends on the event type.

:::tip Note
Every event also has the virtual properties `origin` and `target` whereas each in term point to the `origin` or `target` properties inside the `payload` (if there exists any). Virtual means, these properties are not serialized to JSON and can only be accessed by a pipeline expression (PE). This is handy for filters, since no null check for `payload` is necessary here.
:::

So these paths point to the same whereas the left part will never raise a null exception:

*   `origin = payload.origin` (the origin value **BEFORE** an event happened)
    
*   `target = payload.target` (the final value **AFTER** an event happened)
    

It depends on the event whether `origin` and / or `target` is provided and which structure they have. Please consult the documentation for the certain event.

### async

`true`, in case this event was sent in asynchronous way. Otherwise `false`.

### headers

Optional name-value-pairs to describe the event. Its good practise to filter events based on header values and avoid filtering on payload because of performance.

## Listening for events

In case a pipeline should be executed when a certain event was fired, the `event.listen` command can be used. When the pipeline is deployed, the `event.listen` registers itself as listener to the event system. Whenever an event is fired which matches the `event.listen` criteria, any subsequent commands of this pipeline are executed then.

Lets assume an example: Whenever a new lead was created in Salesforce, the pipeline must send an email to the sales team:

```yaml
pipeline:
 - event.listen:
     key: webhook.salesforce.lead.created
 - mail:
     to: sales@company.tld
     subject: New lead created!
```

After this pipeline was deployed to the property store, it will be executed automatically any time a new event with key `webhook.salesforce.lead.created` happens. In this case a new email will be sent to `sales@company.tld`.

Note: Each pipeline can define exactly one `event.listen` command an it must be the very first command in the pipeline.

### Deep filtering for events

Beside the event key, each event can also be filtered by its properties. So a pipeline gets executed only in case such a filter evaluated with `true`. To do so, you can use the `filter` parameter of the `event.listen` command and place a pipeline expression here. Since the event object is automatically provided in the `body` for you, you can access it there from inside your pipeline expression (PE). For example:

```yaml
pipeline:
 - event.listen:
     key: webhook.salesforce.lead.created
     filter: "#{body.target.CountryCode == 'DE'}"
 - mail:
     to: sales@company.tld
     subject: New lead created in #{body.target.CountryCode}!
```

In the `filter` parameter you can place a pipeline expression (PE). If this expression evaluates with `true`, all subsequent commands after `event.listen` will be executed.

In this example we assume that the event contains the Salesforce `Lead` object so we can filter for the `CountryCode` here. But this depends on the implementation of the webhook.

## Sending an event

In order to send an event, you can use the `event.send` command. Here is an example:

```
pipeline:
  - event.send:
      key: com.company.myevent
```

Every time this pipeline gets executed, it will send a new event with key `com.company.myevent`. Optionally you also set the `payload` of the event using its `payload` parameter. This can be a literal or a pipeline expression (PE) which points to an object to be attached to the payload.

Note: Whenever you send a custom event you need to prefix it with the reversed internet address of your company. In this example it is `com.company`. Otherwise it could be, that your event gets dropped or causes an exception.

## Built-in events

There are several built-in events which you can listen for out-of-the-box. Please refer to the [Events Reference](../api/events).
