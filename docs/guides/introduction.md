# Introduction

We have a two step support process for end user requests. Requests have to be addressed to customer administrator / partner who evaluates the support level. Support Level 1 and 2 is directly handled by the customer administrator / partner. In case of technical / platform related issues and bugs the request should be forwarded to pipeforce via the ticketing system.

The ticketing system can be accessed by a named “Administrator” via: [https://logabit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals](https://logabit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
