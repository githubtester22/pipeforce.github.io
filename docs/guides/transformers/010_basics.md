A transformer in PIPEFORCE is a command which transforms / converts data from one structure into another. There are transformers to 
convert from CSV to JSON, from Word to PDF, from PDF to PNG or to convert from JSON to another structure using a template, just to name a few examples.

See the [commands reference](../../api/commands) for `transformers.*` to see all default transformers available.
